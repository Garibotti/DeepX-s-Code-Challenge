# DeepX-s-Code-Challenge
There are 6 test cases available on mars_test
The first three test cases are testing differents inputs and validating them
The last three cases are validating if the results that are being generated are correct

The forth test case is called "validating results - test case provided my deepx" and it does as it says. Test the application using the input provided by the deepx. 

Considerations:
1 - I have never had any contact with Elixir before
2 - First application "trying" to use functional programming 
3 - I have used 10h on the development on this challange

I appreciate your feedback. Thanks for your time.
